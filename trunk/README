Object Oriented C (ooc) kit is for those who want to program in an object orieneted
manner, but want to stick on the good old C as well.
ooc is lightweight but yet powerfull, uses only ANSI-C, thus highly portable.
ooc implements classes, single inheritance, exception handling.
The primary audience could be students who want to understand the very basics of
object oriented programming and for developers writing applications for platforms that
lack C++ or other object oriented languages.

There are other object oriented C aproaches out there you might be interested in
(for example GObject), however ooc is easy to use, and in addition supports the
use of exceptions.

Install on Linux/Unix:
======================

The usual:
	./configure
	make all pdf html
	sudo make install install-pdf install-html

Read the tutorials, (usually) installed here:
	usr/local/share/doc/ooc/ooc.html/index.html or
	usr/local/share/doc/ooc/ooc.pdf

The API doc can be found (usually) here:
	usr/local/share/doc/ooc/api/html/index.html

Use the ooc tool:
	ooc --help

Compile your own code:
	gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs ooc' my_program.c

Install on Windows or other platforms:
======================================

There is no installer (yet). You can simply copy the source files into your project,
compile and link them together with your project.
For the ooc core functions (class and object management, exception handling) copy:
	ooc.h
	ooc.c
	exception.h
	exception.c
	implement/exception.h

If you'd like to use the other stuff as well, copy the rest.

You must also compile the ooc_tool separately. There gonna be Windows .sln files sometimes ...

======================================

Have fun!
