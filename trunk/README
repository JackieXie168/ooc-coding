Object Oriented C (ooc) kit is for those who want to program in an object orieneted
manner, but want to stick on the good old C as well.
ooc is lightweight but yet powerfull, uses only ANSI-C, thus highly portable.
ooc implements classes, single inheritance, exception handling.
The primary audience could be students who want to understand the very basics of
object oriented programming and for developers writing applications for platforms that
lack C++ or other object oriented languages.

There are other object oriented C aproaches out there you might be interested in
(for example GObject), however ooc is easy to use, and in addition supports the
use of exceptions.

ooc helps you make unit testing easier with a special TestCase class.

Install on Linux/Unix:
======================

The usual:
	./configure
	make all pdf html
	make check
	sudo make install install-pdf install-html

Read the tutorials, (usually) installed here:
	usr/local/share/doc/ooc/ooc.html/index.html or
	usr/local/share/doc/ooc/ooc.pdf

The API doc can be found (usually) here:
	usr/local/share/doc/ooc/api/html/index.html

Use the ooc tool:
	ooc --help

Compile your own code:
	gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs ooc' my_program.c

Install on Windows or other platforms:
======================================

1. Install with the Windows installer

Download the Windows installer package: ooc_win32.msi and install it.
This installer will install the occ files that are necessary for program development with ooc.
It installs the header files, libraries, documentation and the ooc tool.
Also sets the LIB, INCLUDE and PATH environment variables.
Check the Start menu -> All Programs for the ooc folder.

2. Build from scratch

Or alternatively you can compile from source code:

Make sure, you have installed:
	Visual C++ 2008 Express
	glib for win32
	(ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/glib/)

Copy the source files in a project directory,
then open the ooc.sln file with VC++.

You can build ooc now.
(You might need to modify the property sheets in the tools projetc, according
to your glib installation.)

An other possibility to copy the source files into your project directory
compile and link them together with your project.
For the ooc core functions (class and object management, exception handling) copy:
	ooc.h
	ooc.c
	exception.h
	exception.c
	implement/exception.h

If you'd like to use the other stuff as well, copy the rest.

Install for the MPLAB IDE:
======================================

The MPLAB C18 and C30 compiler support is included in the Windows installer.
Install the Windows installer as described above!

Install on other platforms:
======================================
Not ready yet.

======================================

Have fun!
